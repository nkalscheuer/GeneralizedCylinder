   <h3>Points Attempted:</h3>
   <ul>
       <li>Assignment 2: (REQUIRED) Assignment draws a fixed generalized cylinder. By default, the generalized cylinder should have 12 sides.</li>
       <li>Assignment 2: (REQUIRED) If the user just draws a single straight line, a generalized cylinder is drawn around it.</li>
       <li>Assignment 2: (REQUIRED) If the user draws a polyline, generalized cylinders are drawn around each line segment.</li>
       <li>Assignment 2: (REQUIRED) The user can save the model currently on screen to an OBJ file.</li>
       <li>Assignment 2: (REQUIRED) The user can load and display a model from an OBJ file.</li>
       <li>Assignment 2: (EXTRA) The user can set the color of a cylinder.</li>
       <li>Assignment 2: (EXTRA) The user can have multiple cylinders on the screen at once.</li>
       <li>Assignment 2: (EXTRA) The user can delete a specific cylinder.</li>
       <li>Assignment 2: (EXTRA) The user can change the number of sides the cylinder has with a slider.</li>
       <li>Assignment 2:  (EXTRA) The user can change the width of the cylinder with a slider (i.e. the radius of the polygonal face).</li>
   </ul>

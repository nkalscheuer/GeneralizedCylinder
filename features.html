   <h3>Points Attempted:</h3>
   <ul>
       <li>Assignment 3: (REQUIRED) Generalized cylinder is drawn with a solid "skin". Make the default base color of the cylinder green (rgb = (0,1,0)).</li>
       <li>Assignment 3: (REQUIRED) Surface normals are drawn as short lines on your surfaces when a button is pressed. Lines are hidden if the button is pressed again. Make the lines red and unshaded.</li>
       <li>Assignment 3: (REQUIRED) Surfaces are shaded with flat shading by a directional light source coming from (1,1,1) and whose default color is white (1,1,1).</li>
       <li>Assignment 3: (REQUIRED) Have a button that, when clicked, shifts the generalized cylinder by some small amount to the right and redraws the scene.</li>
       <li>Assignment 3: (REQUIRED) Have a button that, when clicked, decrements the x-component of the light direction by some small amount and redraws the scene.</li>
       <li>Assignment 3:  (EXTRA) Have a button that, when pressed, rotates the light direction about the y-axis.</li>
   </ul>
